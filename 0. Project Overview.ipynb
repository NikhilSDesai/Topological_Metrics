    "#### Research Questions\n",
    "    RQ1: Are Points of Interest (POIs) located in areas with expected high traffic flows? This involves percolation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    RQ2: Are POIs located in different places? What is the makeup of POIs at various centrality scores and types of retail located there?\n",
    "\n",
    "    RQ3: Determine the types of retail locations at each scale. Diversity and Density Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    RQ4: How does occupation probability change across network scales? Compare global probability to local probability, assessing changes in occupation probability as scale varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    RQ5: Assess the type of commercial diversity and density at each hierarchical level using a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Purposes of the Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining Scales\n",
    "- Scale Variation Across Systems: Different systems have different scales. Understanding how to define these scales is crucial.\n",
    "- Relationship Between Longest Shortest Path and Node Count: Examining how the longest shortest path relates to the node count in different systems.\n",
    "- Longest Shortest Path for Percolation: Using the longest shortest path to create a scale between cities.\n",
    "- Objective Metric - Distance: Distance serves as a more objective metric for defining scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Process\n",
    "Urban Systems Definition Using Percolation:\n",
    "- Define urban systems based on distance percolation.\n",
    "- Ensure removal of secondary nodes, as irrelevant road segments can distort the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diameter of Network/Node Count Ratio:\n",
    "- Investigate if this ratio is consistent across different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification Based on Ratio:\n",
    "- Classify systems based on whether the diameter/node count ratio is applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance Between Nodes:\n",
    "- Cluster systems based on the distance between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Package 'igraph':\n",
    "- Use this package to remove nodes in step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Consideration\n",
    "- Threshold for City Networks: Removing links above 300 metres can help identify city thresholds.\n",
    "- Subset Analysis: Distance percolation may be unnecessary; a subset approach can be sufficient.\n",
    "- Outcome: One of the results will be the ranking of global vs local occupation probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tools\n",
    "- Cityseer - Gareth's Assistance: Gareth can help assess the location of POIs.\n",
    "- Ziff's Law: Consider Ziff's Law about population for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Steps\n",
    "- POI Location Analysis: Are POIs located where expected?\n",
    "- City Threshold: 300 metres as the threshold for cities.\n",
    "- Exclusion of Small Cities: Cities with populations below 10,000 will be excluded.\n",
    "- Local Angular Percolation: Run angular percolation at a local scale and compare with global results.\n",
    "- Gareth's Role: Gareth will assist in mapping POIs onto the street network to determine their hierarchical state and actual retail location.\n",
    "- Comparative Analysis: Compare the locations of different cities, focusing on the density and diversity of POIs."
